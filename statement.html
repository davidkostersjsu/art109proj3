Doggy Daydream encapsulates the contents of a dog's mind. Dogs do not think in the same way as humans do, and often times their behavior and actions are sporadic. Alternatively, this can also be viewed as someone seeing dogs from the outside, watching their abstract movement and inspecting closer in more detail. I chose to approach this project by implementing photogrammetry and Three.js. The libraries I used were GLTFLoader and OrbitControls. I had tried to get postprocessing working, however I was unable to in the end.
